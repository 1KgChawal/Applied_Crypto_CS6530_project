# RSA Cryptography Implementation

This contains my library implementation for RSA encryption and signing, including OAEP padding and ISO 9796-2 signature scheme

## Libraries

### RSA Library
This library provides functionalities for RSA encryption, decryption, signing, and signature verification and it includes implementations for OAEP padding

**Features:**
- RSA key generation
- RSA encryption and decryption
- OAEP padding and unpadding
- RSA signing and signature verification

### ISO 9796-2 Library
This library provides functionalities for RSA signing and signature verification using the ISO/IEC 9796-2 standard

**Features:**
- RSA signing using ISO/IEC 9796-2
- RSA signature verification using ISO/IEC 9796-2

### Maths Library
This library provides mathematical functions used in RSA operations

**Features:**
- Modular exponentiation
- Primality testing
- Extended Euclidean algorithm
- Prime number generation
- Modular inverse calculation
- GCD calculation
- Least common multiple calculation
- Random number generation

## Prerequisites

**Operating System:** Linux (tested on Linux Mint 21.3/Ubuntu 22.04) or other Unix-like systems

**Required Dependencies:**
- clang++ - C++ compiler with C++17 support
- libgmp-dev - GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
- libgmpxx - C++ bindings for GMP
- libssl-dev - OpenSSL cryptographic library

## Building the Project

The project uses a Makefile-based build system with the following targets:

**Build all executables:**
$ make all

or simply:
$ make


This compiles the library objects into the build/ directory and generates two test executables: rsa_test and iso_9796_2_test.

**Build library objects only:**
$ make build_lib


**Clean build artifacts:**
$ make clean


Removes all executables, object files, and generated key files (*.key, *.pem).

**Rebuild from scratch:**
$ make re_build

Equivalent to running make clean followed by make all.

**Rebuild library only:**
$ make re_build_lib

## Running the Tests

After building, execute the test programs:

**RSA Encryption/Decryption Test:**
$ ./rsa_test

Tests key generation, OAEP encryption/decryption, and digital signatures.

**ISO 9796-2 Signature Test:**
$ ./iso_9796_2_test

Tests signature generation with message recovery and verification.
